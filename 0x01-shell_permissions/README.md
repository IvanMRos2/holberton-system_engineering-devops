# Learning permissions in Shell

In this directory we're going to explain some script of this project.

<ul>
<li> <h1> My name is Betty </h1> </li>
<p> Here we switch the current user to the user called betty. </p>
<li> <h1> Who am I </h1> </li>
<p> This script prints the username of the current user. </p>
