# Learning permissions in Shell

In this directory we're going to explain some script of this project.

<ul>
<li> <b> My name is Betty </b> </li>
<p> Here we switch the current user to the user called betty. </p>
<li> <b> Who am I </b> </li>
<p> This script prints the username of the current user. </p>
<li> <b> Groups </b> </li>
<p> This script prints the groups that the user is part of. </p>

<li> <b> Empty! </b> </li>

<li> <b> Execute </b> </li>                                       <p> This script adds permissions to execute "hello" to the owner </p>
<li> <b> Multiple permissions </b> </li>                          <p> This script gives execute permissions to the owner and the group owner, and to the other users gives read permissions </p>
